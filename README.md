# Hi, I‚Äôm Idan üëã

**Computer Science student @ Reichman University | Backend Developer (C# & Java) | Ex-IDF Paratrooper Commander**

I focus on building **robust backend systems** with **C# (.NET Core)** and **Java (Spring Boot)**.  
At the same time, I‚Äôve explored **Machine Learning** and **Systems Programming in C**, which gives me a broad perspective on software performance and scalability.
